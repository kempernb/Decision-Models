The expression _row[0]_ will return the first element of the tuple which is the name of the distribution center. The expression _row[1:]_ uses the slicing syntax to return all the other elements of the tuple. If we create a dictionary called _out_cost_, we can create an item in that dictionary using _row[0]_ as the key and _row[1:]_ as the value to store all the outbound costs associated with this distribution center. You can embed this approach within a for-loop to store the entire table of outbound costs in the dictionary."
